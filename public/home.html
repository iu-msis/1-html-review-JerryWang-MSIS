                <br><h3>Welcome to Pied Piper</h3><br>
                <h4>About Us</h4>
                <p>We are a growing file compression company that is determined to <strong>making the world a better place.</strong></p>
                <p>Individual users and businesses are using up more and more data storage. Just look at your phone. You will likely find over a dozen apps, hundreds of photos and thousands of messages. 
                    We all want to be able to securely store those important files, access them at any time and send them to our friends and family.
                    Unfortunately, there are not enough processing power or storage space to make that a reality.</p>
                <p id="untilnow">Until Now!</p>
                <p>Pied Piper's advanced compression technology allows you to compress large files and send them quickly to anyone across the world. Don't worry, the quality of your photo, video or files will not remail the same.
                    It is like MAGIC.</p>

                <h4>Meet our Team</h4>
